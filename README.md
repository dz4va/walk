THIS IS AN OLD PROJECT, CONSIDER NOT LOOKING AT THIS.<br/><br/><br/>


Walk!
==============

This is just something you can call whatever you want.
I was just making some kind of connection while working on canvas as there are many many colors.
Everything is randomized: Music Notes,Colors,Coordinates,Pretty Much Everything.

There is a color code generator inside the javascript file but at this time works for 0-9.
There is also intro color changer and other I think interesting stuff for the first practice project.
I'm self tought in this kind of programming(HTML5/CSS/Javascript).
<br>If you'd like to ask what does this all mean, I have an Answer for you:<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At some point something happens and you can wait for that moment, though I think this all can go forever.

Thanks for checking my first project out!

Wish You A Flawless Bugless Coding!
