Walk!
==============

This is just something you can call whatever you want.
I was just making some kind of connection while working on canvas as there are many many colors.

There is a color code generator inside the javascript file but at this time works for 0-9.
There is also intro color changer and other I think interesting stuff for the first practice project.
I'm self tought in this kind of programming(HTML5/CSS/Javascript).

Thanks for checking my first project out!

Wish You A Flawless Bugless Coding!
